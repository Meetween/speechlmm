# Question
What might this statement suggest about the speaker's perception of the person in question and their own beliefs or expectations?

# Answer
The statement implies that the speaker is discussing someone who did not pursue a career or role within the church, despite the speaker's lack of surprise at this outcome. The use of the phrase "I need not say" indicates a sense of certainty or obviousness on the part of the speaker. This suggests that either the person being discussed had traits or inclinations that made it clear they were unlikely to pursue a religious vocation, or that the speaker had a distinct perception of the individual that did not align with such a path. The speaker's expectation, or lack thereof, could reveal insights into their own beliefs or expectations regarding individuals and their career choices. Additionally, the choice of words might suggest a certain detachment or neutrality in the speaker's attitude towards the individual's career path, indicating that it was not a matter of personal concern or importance to them.
